                Dear Mr. Andrews,

                I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective September 16, 2022.I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program 
                starts in late September. I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.I’ve truly enjoyed my time working 
                with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, and perhaps more rare
                to find such a positive, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.

                I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me. Please let me know if there’s 
                anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.

                
                                                                    <center><p>Thanks and best wishes,</p></center>
                Signature (hard copy letter)
